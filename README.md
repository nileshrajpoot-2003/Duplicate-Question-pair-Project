# Duplicate-Question
This project addresses the Quora Question Pair Competition, where the objective is to identify whether two questions asked on Quora are semantically equivalent or not.

Duplicate questions reduce the quality of information on Q&A platforms. By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques, this model predicts if two given questions convey the same intent.
